## Demo

For convenience, you can check my [online demo](http://daev-portfolio.online:3000/) hosted in my personal server.


## Running on Local (Recommended)

To build and run in local:

```bash
# first, build the project using
npm run build

# wait until finished
# then, start the server using
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running for development purposes

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors running the build or dev server, please make sure you have Node version 15.0.0 and up
